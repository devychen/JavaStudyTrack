<h3>Question: Is there a relation between the length of the words and their number of appearance?</h3>
<p>
<b>Answer:</b> Yes. There is a relationship between the length of a word and its frequency
in a text corpus: The more frequent a word is, the shorter it is. This is one insight
from Zipf's laws stated by George Kingsley Zipf (1902-1950, american linguist).
