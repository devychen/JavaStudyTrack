# Goal

Write a program to find word-ladders: connections from one word to another formed by changing one letter at a time with the constraint that each of the resulting string of letters is a meaningful word (see the slides for more information).

# Before you start
Download `wordlistWithNeighbours4.txt`. 
Each line contains a word followed by its neighbors - i.e. all the other words in the dictionary that are just one letter different than itself.

Download the starter-code for this selftest:  `WordLadderSolver.java`


# Exercise
Fill in the missing implementation of the solve method.  Use the comments and the declared local variables as a guide.
