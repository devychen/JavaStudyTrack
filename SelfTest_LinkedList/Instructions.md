### CircularlyLinkedList - Josephus

Josephus Flavius was a famous Jewish historian of the first century 
at the time of the Second Temple destruction. During the Jewish-Roman war he got trapped in a cave 
with a group of 39 soldiers surrounded by Romans.  <br>
The legend has it that preferring suicide to capture, 
the Jews decided to form a circle and, 
proceeding clockwise around it, 
to kill every seventh person until only one was left, 
who must then commit suicide.  <br>
Josephus, an accomplished mathematician, 
quickly found the safe spot in the circle (24th) to be the last to go.  
But when the time came, instead of killing himself he joined the Roman side.

Let's write a program to simulate a less bloody version 
the problem using a circularly-linked list.

### Step 1:
Create a directory for this exercise and download the following files there: <br>
_CircularlyLinkedList.java_ <br>
_CircularlyLinkedListTest.java_ <br>
_CircularlyLinkedListException.java_ <br>

### Step 2:
Start DrJava or NetBeans and open _CircularlyLinkedList*.java_
in a project.  
Create a project (called ss15_st2, for example).

### Step 3:
Fill in the missing parts of the CircularlyLinkedList class.
Use the junit tests provided to ensure that your methods work as they should.

### Step4:
Add the following files to your project: <br>
_Josephus.java_ <br>
_JosephusTest.java_ <br>
Write the play method in the Josephus class. <br>
Add a test method in JosephusTest that plays the game with the people sitting near you.<br>
Who has to start the counting for YOU to win?
